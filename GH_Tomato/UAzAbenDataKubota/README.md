# Description of data *Aben Data Kubota Whalen*

CSV data files contain environmental data collected inside two greenhouses used in an experiment comparing different glazing materials.  

__Objective of this data collection:__ To identify the influence of two different glazing materials for a pad-and-fan cooled greenhouse.  

## Data collected:  
- PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), measured as photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) inside the greenhouse (A and B), unit: Î¼mol m-2 s-1 [one location in each greenhouse]  
- Air temperature and relative humidity inside the greenhouse (A and B); unit oC and % [one location in each greenhouse]  
- Air temperature and relative humidity recorded at the weather station outside the greenhouse; unit oC and %  
  
## Data collection methods and quality:  
- PAR was measured using a Licor quantum sensor (model LI-190, Licor, Lincoln, NE) manufacturer calibrated prior to the start of data collection. The sensor was placed on a horizontal beam at the gutter height in the center of each greenhouse.  
- Air temperature and relative humidity inside and outside the greenhouse were measured using a Vaisala temperature and humidity prove (model HMP10, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) inside a radiation shield aspirated at 3 m/s.  The sensors were new and manufacturer-calibrated prior to the start of data collection.  
- All sensors were connected to a Campbell CR1000 data logger and the sensor readings were scanned every 5 seconds to average over 10 min.
