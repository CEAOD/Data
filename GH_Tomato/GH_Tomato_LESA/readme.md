# RPI_LESA_Repository
## LESA's Github Repository for Plant Growth Data


This is the *ReadMe* file for *CHMOD’s Plant Database!*

This is an Open-Source github repository that aims to collaborate Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Lighting and Systems Based Applications research with various other academic institutions and researchers to eventually move towards predictive analytics and machine learning.

We are currently conducting research regarding the optimization of plant growth with respect to environmental factors such as Humidity, Temperature, and CO2 Emission. 

We are storing Metadata in regards to the sensors we are using right here:
